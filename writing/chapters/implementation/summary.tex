In all, we have added predictive auto-scaling to Kubernetes, as well as
creating the infrastructure to make this addition possible. We added calculation of
the average pod initialization time as well as storing previous measurements of
CPU utilization and the time at which they occurred. These two pieces of
information allowed us to create a linear line of best fit which we used to
predict the future CPU utilization, and thus predict the number of replica pods
we would need in the future. In short, it allowed us to predictively auto-scale.
Finally, we specified a mechanism for turning predictive auto-scaling on and
off. Our version of Kubernetes, with predictive auto-scaling operational, can be
deployed to Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, or physical hardware
just like any other Kubernetes version.
