This thesis presents our given contributions to Kubernetes. Kubernetes seeks to
ensure high application quality of service and efficient resource utilization,
and our contributions look to further its ability to accomplish these
goals. As such, we present not only new methodology, but also new, working
implementations with an accompanying evaluation. Through constructing and
utilizing an evaluation framework, we comment on when predictive
auto-scaling is the correct choice and when it is not. Finally, we
discuss the experiences of making these modifications to Kubernetes, as well as
avenues for future improvements with respect to Kubernetes and cluster managers in
general.
