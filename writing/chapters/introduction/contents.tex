The remainder of this thesis begins with an exploration of this problem's
background, as we explore resource intensive computing paradigms, cluster
managers, auto-scaling, and Kubernetes. We progress to a general overview of the
architecture underlying Kubernetes, with a specific focus on the current
implementation of reactive auto-scaling, and our proposed future addition of
predictive auto-scaling. We then discuss our implementation of predictive
auto-scaling in Kubernetes. With our implementaiton established, we perform an
evaluation of our changes. Finally, we comment on future avenues of exploration
and summarize the contributions of this thesis.
