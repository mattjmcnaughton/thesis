The remainder of this thesis begins with an exploration of this problem's
background, as we explore resource intensive computing paradigms, cluster
managers, auto-scaling, and Kubernetes in Chapter \ref{background}.
We progress to a general overview of the
architecture underlying Kubernetes in Chapter \ref{architecture},
with a specific focus on the current
implementation of reactive auto-scaling, and our proposed future addition of
predictive auto-scaling. We then discuss our implementation of predictive
auto-scaling in Kubernetes in Chapter \ref{implementation}.
With our implementation established, we perform an
evaluation of our changes in Chapter \ref{evaluation}.
Finally, we comment on future avenues of exploration
and summarize the contributions of this thesis in Chapter \ref{conclusion}.
