As a popular open-source project, Kubernetes codes is rapidly changing. Thus it
does not make sense to include significant portions of the Kubernetes code in
this section. However, the modifications made to this thesis are all publicly
accessible on our fork of the Kubernetes project, with the eventual hope that
they will additionally be available on the Kubernetes master branch. The code
can be found at
\url{https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton/kubernetes/tree/add-predictive-autoscaling}.
Almost all of the modifications made over the course of this thesis occurred in
the \code{pkg/controller/podautoscaler}.

Additionally, all of the code written to perform the evaluations is open-source.
