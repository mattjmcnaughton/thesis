In summation, we discussed the variety of methods for performing resource intensive
computational tasks, before focusing on cluster computing. We examined a variety
of popular cluster managers, and investigated the distinguishing characteristics
of Kubernetes, the cluster manager which is the focus of this thesis. Finally, we examined
a variety of methods of auto-scaling applications running on cluster managers,
and suggested a new auto-scaling method for Kubernetes entitled
model predictive control. The remainder of this thesis
seeks to show the effectiveness of model predictive control in modifying the
current implementation of auto-scaling in Kubernetes, such that we will increase
the summation of ERU and QOS.
