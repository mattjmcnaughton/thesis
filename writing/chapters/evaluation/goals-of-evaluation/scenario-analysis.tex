Our evaluation will also attempt to provide further insight into predictive auto-scaling
through analyzing the impacts of predictive auto-scaling in relation to itself.
In other words, we will seek to identify the scenarios in which benefits or
detriments of predictive auto-scaling are the most pronounced, and also the
scenarios in which predictive auto-scaling has little impact. This method of
analysis will be useful in recommending when to enable predictive auto-scaling
and also will likely suggest avenues for future work.
