Our evaluation provides further insight into predictive auto-scaling
through analyzing the impacts of predictive auto-scaling in different scenarios.
In other words, we seek to identify the scenarios in which the benefits or
detriments of predictive auto-scaling are the most pronounced, and also the
scenarios in which predictive auto-scaling has little impact. This method of
analysis is useful in recommending when to enable predictive auto-scaling
and also suggests avenues for future work.
