One important aspect of evaluation will be presenting a number of different
scenarios, based on independent variables that will be discussed later, in which
to evaluate predictive auto-scaling in comparison to the alternative methods
of assigning resources. This type of evaluation will focus on how predictive
auto-scaling is an improvement, or regression, on the currently existing
options. Furthermore, this type of evaluation will focus on to what extent
predictive auto-scaling's difference from current implementations,
is statistically and practically significant. Finally, this type of evaluation will
provide a number of visualizations and summary statistics, allowing for
easily accessible comparisons between different types of resource assignment
in different scenarios.
