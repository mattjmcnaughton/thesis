We examine two independent variables, traffic request pattern and pod
initialization time, with respect to the different scaling types' performance.
In other words, for under-, average-, and over-static, reactive, and predictive
auto-scaling, we examine the impacts of varying the request pattern of traffic
to our testing application and the impacts of differing pod initialization
times. This allows us to determine under what combinations of traffic request
patterns and pod initialization time predictive auto-scaling is most effective,
and also under what combinations it is the least effective. Furthermore, because
we utilize the same independent variables for all of the different scaling
types, and because these independent variables are relevant to all scaling
types, we can make comparisons across the scaling types. For example, we could
determine that predictive auto-scaling outperforms reactive auto-scaling most
when pod initialization time is lengthy and the traffic pattern is a simple
linear slope, but predictive auto-scaling exhibits very little difference from
reactive auto-scaling when pod initialization time is very small and we see a
\textit{flash crowd} traffic pattern.
