As has been discussed in the previous sections, we are interested in visualizing
and understanding the difference in performance between predictive and
horizontal auto-scaling for one pod initialization time and four
different traffic patterns. As such, we have four different tests on which we
compare ERU and QoS: step-ladder traffic pattern with 135s pod initialization
time, jagged-edge traffic pattern with 135s pod initialization time,
increase-decrease traffic pattern with 135s pod
initialization time and flash-crowd traffic pattern with 135s pod initialization time.

For each test on the matrix, we provide two different sources of information.
First, we generate a graph comparing the summation of ERU and QoS across the
evaluation time for predictive and reactive auto-scaling. Additionally,
we provide statistical measurements for the difference of predictive and
reactive auto-scaling at the same point in the evaluation sequence (i.e. we
compare the summation of ERU and QoS after 10 minutes for predictive with the
summation of ERU and QoS after 10 minutes for reactive). With respect to
statistical measurements, we calculate a one-sided p-value
based on the null hypothesis that the difference
between the summation of ERU and QoS for predictive and reactive auto-scaling is
$0$. As we are interested in seeing if predictive auto-scaling performs better
than reactive auto-scaling, we calculate a one-sided p-value, $p$, with the alternative
hypothesis that the difference between the summation of ERU and QoS for
predictive and reactive auto-scaling is greater than $0$. We test for
significance at the $5\%$ significance level, meaning that if $p < 0.05$, we can
reject our null hypothesis in favor of our alternative hypothesis that
predictive auto-scaling performs better than reactive auto-scaling for this
combination of traffic pattern and pod initialization time.
