As has been discussed in the previous sections, we are interested in visualizing
and understanding the difference in performance between predictive and
horizontal auto-scaling for two different pod initialization times and two
different traffic patterns. As such, we have four different tests on which we
compare ERU and QOS: increase-decrease traffic pattern with 5s pod
initialization time, increase-decrese traffic pattern with 135s pod
initialization time, flash-crowd traffic pattern with 5s pod initialization
time, and flash-crowd traffic pattern with 135s pod initialization time. This
grouping of tests can be visualized through the matrix seen in Table
\ref{tab:testmatrix}.

\begin{table}
  \setlength{\extrarowheight}{2pt}
  \begin{tabular}{*{4}{c|}}
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Pod Initialization Time}\\\cline{3-4}
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{} &  & 5s  & 135s \\\cline{2-4}
    \multirow{2}*{Traffic Pattern}  & increase-decrease & (5s, i-d) & (135s, i-d) \\\cline{2-4}
    & flash-crowd & (5s, f-c) & (135s, f-c) \\\cline{2-4}
  \end{tabular}
