To determine the impact of adding prediction to horizontal pod auto-scaling, we
must establish baseline standards of performance with which we can perform comparisons.
These ``normal'' standards of performance come from the control group, which
includes all of the methods of scaling pods before this thesis. These methods
can be divided into the two general categories of \textit{static} and
\textit{reactive auto-scaling}. The inclusion in our control group of all
previous methods of auto-scaling allows us to answer one fundamental question of
this thesis: does adding prediction to Kubernetes auto-scaling improve its
ability to reliably and resourcefully run containerized applications?
