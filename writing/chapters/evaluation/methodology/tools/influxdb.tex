Our evaluation strategy generates an immense amount of time-series data, which
we need to store in a database that we can later query and manipulate.
\textit{InfluxDB}, an open-source time-series database from InfluxData, is a
natural choice for recording such data. InfluxDB makes it easy to collect,
store, manage, and visualize the large amount of data that we generate.
InfluxDB provides a simple HTTP API which we use both for recording our data
throughout are evaluations, and also for querying and modifying later.
Finally, InfluxDB has a variety of hosting options, meaning our containerized application
does not have to hold any data, and thus remains stateless and concurrent.
