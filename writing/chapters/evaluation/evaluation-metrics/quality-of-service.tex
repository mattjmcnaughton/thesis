We additionally define quality of service as a measure of how well an application
is accomplishing its goal. There does not exist a singular consistent specific
metric for measuring quality of service, as measures of quality of service are dependent on
the specific application. Furthermore, it is difficult to measure quality of
service as a variety of difficult-to-control-for external factors impact an
application's ability to perform its goal.

In the context of the typical web application run on Kubernetes, we measure
quality of service based on the server side
\code{ResponseTime} to an HTTP request. An application
with a high quality of service will have a low response time, while an
application with a low quality of service will have a high response time. We
measure our specific metric for quality of service in seconds.

The quality of service metric has links to the type of application which can be
run on Kubernetes. As Kubernetes supports as best as possible a high quality of
service, more and more important applications will run on Kubernetes. For
example, if Kubernetes works to improve the quality of service of an
application, important web applications serving vital medical data or political
information will seek Kubernetes as a platform on which to run.
