Additionally, previous to this thesis, it was possible to scale applications in
Kubernetes using horizontal, reactive pod based auto-scaling. We examine the implementation
and utilization of this method of scaling in depth in the section
\ref{architecture-autoscaling-in-kubernetes}, so we will not repeat it here.
