In the introduction section of this thesis, we defined success as implementing
modifications to Kubernetes that increase the summation of the
efficient resource utilization and quality of service metrics. Careful
evaluation can confirm whether we succeeded in this objective. In all, we
seek to determine both the extent and significance of the addition of predictive
auto-scaling in comparison to reactive auto-scaling,
and highlight the scenarios in which the addition
of predictive auto-scaling is the most, and the least, beneficial.
