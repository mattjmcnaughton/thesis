Most importantly, thank you to my advisor, Jeannie Albrecht, for her wisdom and
enthusiasm both during this thesis and my entire time doing computer
science Williams. Thank you to my second reader, Brendan Burns, for his advice
and assistance. Without Professor Albrecht and Brendan, this thesis would not
have been possible. Additionally, thank you to Andrew Udell for his assistance
creating visualizations and for the entire Kubernetes community for their
assistance answering questions. Without all these people, this thesis would not
have been possible.

Thank you to my parents, David and Janice, my brother
Christopher, and my twin sister Kathryn for their love and support. Finally, thank you to
my girlfriend Sarah and my friends for their encouragement.
