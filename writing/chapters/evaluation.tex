Given an addition of auto-scaling, it is now necessary to progress to
evaluation. This section contains a more thorough definition of what entails
successful modification of current Kubernetes auto-scaling behavior, the metrics
used to determine if efforts were successful, an analysis of the control groups
with which the new predictive auto-scaling will be compared, a description of
the environment and process used for evaluation, the results of said
evaluations, and the real world impacts of this thesis' findings.
