Introducing the Kubernetes specific vocabulary used through the cluster manager
will make the following discussions of auto-scaling easier. In addition to
describing each component of Kubernetes in general, Figure
\ref{fig:kubernetes-visualization-no-autoscaler} presents an overview of the
interaction between the different building blocks which compose Kubernetes.
Figure \ref{fig:kubernetes-visualization-no-autoscaler} also gives a sense of
the life cycle of an external request from an external client
to a service running on Kubernetes.
Importantly, this visualization shows just one service. Multiple different
services can be run on a Kubernetes cluster, each with their own service,
replication controller, and pods.
