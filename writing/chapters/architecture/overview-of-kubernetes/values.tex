As with all large computer programs, a number of values inform the development of
Kubernetes. The values must pertinent to this thesis are the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \underline{Portability}: As will be seen in the next section,
    Kubernetes can be run in a number of different environments. As a result,
    Kubernetes presents potential solutions to a number of different problems, and
    increasing Kubernetes performance, as this thesis attempts to do, will assist in
    this ability.
  \item \underline{Extensibility}: Kubernetes is built to
    easily incorporate pluggable new changes which can be easily enabled or
    disabled. Understanding the importance of pluggability will motivate this
    thesis' suggested modifications to Kubernetes.
  \item \underline{Automatic}: Kubernetes places an emphasis on important
    cluster management tasks occurring without necessary user involvement. For
    example, if an application crashes, Kuberentes will automatically restart
    it. This emphasis on automation means this thesis' work on auto-scaling
    should be particularly valuable, as it improves Kubernetes ability to
    accomplish one of its fundamental goals \cite{what-is-k8s}.
\end{itemize}
