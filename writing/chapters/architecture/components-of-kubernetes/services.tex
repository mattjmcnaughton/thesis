The final main architectural building block of Kubernetes is the service.
Services are necessary because pods are ephemeral. As a pod may be deleted or
replaced at any time, it is important that no entity is trying to communicate
with a specific pod, because that pod may disappear. Instead, entities wishing to
communicate with a pod always establish contact with a \textit{service}.
A service offers just such a consistent endpoint. A service presents a
single, long-running access point for multiple replica pods, as it receives
external requests to the pods, and load-balances
these requests across the replicas.\footnote{The replication of
these pods is handled by a replication controller.} This endpoint is used within
a Kubernetes cluster as pods wish to communicate with each other and it can also
be exposed outside of the cluster. Again, the concept of a service is
particularly important to auto-scaling, as when the replication
controller creates pod replicas, the services ensures work is balanced across
them. This load-balancing, and the knowledge of the new replicas on which to
share the load, is entirely automated.\cite{k8s-services}
