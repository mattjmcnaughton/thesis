The pod is the smallest deployable unit that Kubernetes can create and
manage. Importantly, the pod's role as the smallest abstraction means a user of
Kubernetes does not interact with containers, except to the extent that
containers are contained within a pod. A pod can contain one or more
applications, and one or more containers can comprise each of these applications.
Multiple applications should run on the same pod
if these applications need to be run on the same
physical machine; otherwise, the applications should be in separate pods.
Applications within a pod can see each other's processes,
access the same IP network, and share the same host name. Like well-designed
containers within the microservices model, well-designed containers should be
focused, stateless, and concurrent. Kubernetes assumes that pods can be deleted,
created, and replicated at will. The user can either submit a
single pod to Kubernetes to schedule and run on a node in the cluster, or pods
can be created by a replication controller \cite{k8s-pods}.
