Again, it is important to remember that containerization, microservices, and
cluster management are not entirely new innovations. Yet, what is unique and
important about these advancements is the intended audience. While development to expand
the technical merits of containerization, microservices, and cluster management
continues, equally important, and more novel, work is being done to increase
educational resources and promote accessibility. Kubernetes' core value of
automation, and this thesis' specific goal of improving the performance of
auto-scaling, coincides with this goal of accessibility, as it reduces the scope
of concern for a new user of these technologies and allows new users to focus on
their application.
