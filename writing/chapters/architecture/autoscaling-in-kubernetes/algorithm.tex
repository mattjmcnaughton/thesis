The current algorithm for determining the number of replicas at each interval
of the control loop is fairly simple.
To begin, it requires the definition of
three variables. Let \code{TargetNumOfPods} be defined as the number of
replica pods which should exist. The replication controller will be responsible
for ensuring these pods exist. Let \code{SumCurrentPodsCPUUtilization} be
found by multiplying the average pod CPU utilization by the current number of
replica pods. Finally, let \code{TargetCPUUtilization} be the desired level of
per pod CPU utilization percentage as specified by the user when they created
the autoscaler. The algorithm can now be written as follows:

\[ \mbox{TargetNumOfPods} = \mbox{ceiling(SumCurrentPodsCPUUtilization /
TargetCPUUtilization)} \]

The \code{ceiling} function simply ensures that there is no attempt to create
fractions of pods. Additionally, to keep auto-scaling from being overly
sensitive, scaling will only occur if the current resource utilization is
outside of a 10\% tolerance range \cite{k8s-horizontal-pod-autoscaler-proposal}.

Implementing this thesis' new auto-scaling additions, namely utilizing
predictive feedback control, will require modifications to this algorithm.
