As was mentioned in the general overview of Kubernetes, Kubernetes benefits not
only from over a decade of experience of utilizing cluster managers at Google,
but also from the distributed systems community's mass adoption of new
technologies with low barriers to entry for new users. Kubernetes both benefits
from this trend, and contributes to making the benefits of distributed systems
more accessible. The most prominent, increasingly popular technologies/paradigms
influencing Kubernetes are containerization, or more specifically
containerization, and microservices. A basic understanding of both will assist
in understanding the Kubernetes basic, and auto-scaling specific, design.
