\section{Goals}

\subsection{General}

\begin{frame}{General}
  Contribute to distributed system's ability to reliably and resourcefully
  perform large, varying amounts of computational work.

  % This presentation and thesis focus on work that is much too big to be
  % performed by any single commodity machine. For example, serving an extremely
  % popular website like "www.google.com".
\end{frame}

\subsection{Specific}

\begin{frame}{Specific}
  We seek to maximize the sum of two metrics: Efficient Resource Utilization and
  Quality of Service.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Efficient Resource Utilization (ERU)}
  A measure of whether an application is efficiently using the resources it is
  given.

  % Resource can be anything - CPU, memory, network bandwidth\ldots The most
  % common, and the one we will investigate throughout this thesis, is CPU.

  % An example of poor resource utilization is running a webserver handling one
  % static file request per minute on a super
  % computer. It is probably using less than 1\% of the available CPU.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Quality of Service (QOS)}
  A measure of whether the application is accomplishing its stated purpose.

  % Measurements of quality of service depend on the purpose of the application. For
  % example, if the application is a webserver, a measure of quality of service
  % might be the time it takes for the application to respond to a client's
  % request.

  % A critical assumption of this thesis is that quality of service is at least
  % in some ways impacted by access to a proper amount of computing resources.
  % This makes intuitive sense. Returning to the example of the webserver, if
  % the webserver is allocated 1\% of a commodity PC's CPU, but receives thousands of
  % requests per minute, it will have a horrid response time and thus a low
  % quality of service.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Balancing ERU and QOS}
  Our goal is to maximize the summation of ERU and QOS. We want one of the
  following:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item ERU to increase and QOS to stay constant.
      % If ERU increases, but QOS stays constant, we are able to reduce the
      % amount of resources our application needs without harming performance.
    \item ERU to stay constant and QOS to increase.
      % If QOS increases, but ERU stays constant, we are able to increase the
      % performance of our application while maintaining the amount of resources
      % used.
    \item Both!
      % This is the dream\ldots Better performance and less resources used.
  \end{itemize}

  Accomplishing these goals can have substantial real world impacts.

  % If we improve ERU, then less resources are needed to run applications. Less
  % resources translates to lower costs. These savings can be substantial if
  % massive amounts of computation are being performed. If we improve quality of
  % service, we can begin to run more and more mission-critical applications.

  % Overall, the goal is to lower the costs and increase the reliability of
  % performing massive amounts of computation. Increase the groups of people who
  % can obtain large amounts of computing power and increase the problems to
  % which this mass of computing power can be applied.
