# Containers

This directory contains Dockerfiles for common containers that I need throughout
the course of this thesis. Containers are placed in this directory if they are
not substantial enough to be associated with a single directory (i.e. the
configuration for the custom container for Apache JMeter is in the `traffic`
directory.)

## Container List

- thesis-python: This container is a python development environment containing
  all of the dependencies that I need (i.e. jinja, influxdb, numpy...)
