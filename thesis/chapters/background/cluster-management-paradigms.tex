As was briefly mentioned in the introduction, cluster managers are responsible
for admitting, scheduling, running, maintaining, and monitoring all applications
and jobs a user wishes to run on the cluster.\footnote{Application, job, and
task are largely interchangeable names for computing work performed on the
cluster.} As we previously mentioned, cluster managers can be thought of as the
operating system for the cluster. Naturally, cluster managers are
extremely diverse, both in the types of applications and jobs they are best
suited to running, and the method in which they seek execute their duties.
At the most basic level, there are two types of workload that may be submitted
to a cluster manager: production and batch. Production tasks are long-running
with strict performance requirements and heightened penalties for downtime. Batch tasks are
more flexible in their ability to handle short-term performance variance. In the
context of a large company like Google, a production task would be serving a
large website like Gmail or Google Search, which must be continuously
accessible with low-latency
and little downtime; a batch task could be analysing advertising analytics data
with MapReduce, which can fail or slow without significant external
costs.\cite[pg. 1]{borg} The type of tasks a cluster management system
predominantly seeks to run dictate many of the cluster manager's implementation details.

One varying factor in a cluster manager's implementation is the process by which
by which the cluster manager schedules jobs.\footnote{Just like scheduling jobs
  on an operating system, Scheduling jobs on
a cluster equates to assigning jobs to resources on a machine in the cluster.}
There exist three
predominant methods of scheduling: monolithic, two-level, and
shared state. With monolithic scheduling, a single algorithm
is responsible for taking the resource requests of all jobs and assigning them
to the proper machine. With two-level scheduling, the cluster manager simply
offers resources, which can then be accepted or rejected by the distributed
computing frameworks.\footnote{Distributed computing frameworks are frameworks
built to function over multiple machines. Some populate examples include
Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark\dots}
Finally, with shared state scheduling, multiple different algorithms concurrently work to
schedule jobs on the cluster.\cite[pg. 1]{omega} Naturally, all
of these methods have positives and negatives. While monolithic scheduling is
initially simple to implement if the jobs being scheduled are homogeneous,
a single-threaded monolithic scheduler does not allow
nuanced processing of diverse jobs based on varying heuristics and guideslines.
Attempts to add this nuance can create an incredibly
complicated algorithm that is difficult to extend.\cite[pg. 353-354]{omega}
While two-level scheduling is lightweight, simple, and offers advantages with respect to
data locality, it is not effective for long-running,
production jobs.\cite[pg. 7]{omega}
Finally, while shared state scheduling removes the scheduler as
both a computational and complexity bottleneck, it must take steps to guarantee
global properties of the cluster and address the typical challenges of
concurrent programs.\cite[pg. 363]{omega}
The chosen scheduling method
effects the type of applications and distributed computing frameworks
runnable on the cluster manager and the efficiency with which these applications
and frameworks run.

A final distinction is the licensing and availability of the cluster manager's code.
Because cluster managers are necessary only in the presence of vast amounts of
data and computation, predominantly large
corporations develop and utilize cluster managers. Often these cluster
managers are kept within the confines of the corporation, or only explained by a
brief paper or conference talk, with little source code available. In more
unique cases, the company will open-source the source code, allowing anyone to
view, modify, and run the cluster manager. Such open-sourcing presents a unique opportunity
for researchers wishing to experiment with cluster managers, but lacking the
resources to create their own from scratch. In rarer instances, a
fully-developed cluster manager will originate from academic research. In unique
scenarios, a large corporation will adope a cluster manager originating in
academic and the entire code base will
be open-sourced. The availability of source code directly impacts the
feasibility of pursuing experiments with already existing cluster management
systems.

Naturally, cluster managers can vary in multiple additional ways. However,
the previous three differences recognize the most important distinctions in
the context of this thesis. Given this understanding, we can know begin to examine specific
cluster management implementations and defend our choice of Kubernetes as the
cluster manager on which we will ask and answer our research question.
