Overall, there are a number of lessons to be learned in this section. In
summation, we discussed the variety of methods for performing resource intensive
computational tasks, before focusing on cluster computing. We examined a variety
of popular cluster managers, before focusing on Kubernetes. Finally, we examined
a variety of methods of auto-scaling applications running on cluster managers,
before focusing on model predictive control. The remainder of this thesis will
seeks to show the effectiveness of model predictive control in modifying the
current implementation of auto-scaling in Kubernetes, such that we will improve
both quality of service and efficient resource utilization.
