The final main architectural building block of Kubernetes is the service.
Services are necessary because pods are ephemeral. As a pod may be deleted or
replaced at any time, it is important that no entity is trying to communicate
with a specific pod, because that pod may disappear. What is needed is a
consistent endpoint with which entities wishing to communicate with a pod can
always contact. A service is just such a consistent endpoint. Services prevent a
single, long-running access points for multiple replica pods, as it receives
requests to the pods, and load-balances them among the replicas.\footnote{The replication of
these pods is handled by a replication controller.} This endpoint is used within
a Kubernetes cluster as pods wish to communicate with each other and it can also
be exposed outside of the cluster. Again, the concept of a service is
particularly important to auto-scaling, as when the replication
controller creates pod replicas, the services ensures work is balanced across
them. This load-balancing, and the knowledge of the new replicas on which to
share the load, is entirely automated.\cite{k8s-services}
