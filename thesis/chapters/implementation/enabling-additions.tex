This section analyzes the specific additions enabling predictive auto-scaling.
The changes are broken intro four groups: Recording Pod Initilization Time,
Calculating Resource Usage Derivative, Autoscaling Predictively, and Enabling
Predictive Autoscaling. The first two groups do not directly relate to
predictive auto-scaling, but rather are the scaffolding that makes predictive
auto-scaling possible. The third group, Autoscaling Predictively, builds upon
the first two sections in implementing an alternative control flow, which when
enabled, causes the auto-scaler to operate predictively instead of reactively.
The last group of changes discusses how to turn in this alternative control
flow, and thus enable predictive auto-scaling. While breaking this thesis' code
into discrete compartments is in part just a reflection proper software design,
it is also done to work within the framework of making open-source contributes
to Kubernetes. Kubernetes preferences small, self-contained requests, which are
able to function independently. Implementing the sections sequentially, ensures
we never submit code which will not run or build.
