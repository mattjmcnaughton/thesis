\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

The Kubernetes cluster manager\cite{k8s-website} controls all aspects of a
cluster through admitting, running, and restarting applications, monitoring and
displaying application health, and maintaining the underlying machines composing
the cluster. Currently the Kubernetes cluster manager implements autoscaling,
ensuring applications scale to meet varying external
demands.\cite{k8s-horizontal-pod-autoscaler-proposal} We seek to
improve autoscaling to decrease the amount of time
replicated applications must handle too much or too little demand, increasing
the efficiency and responsiveness of Kubernetes.

\section{Process and Implementation}

Kubernetes is uniquely both completely open source under the Apache License, and
in production use at Google.\cite{google-container-engine} Ultimately, the goal
is for the Kubernetes project to accept this work into their master distribution.
Thus, the norms and
requirements of the Kubernetes community, as well as the current implementation
of Kubernetes, will influence the implementation of our autoscaling
modifications. The implementation steps are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Propose autoscaling modifications to the Kubernetes community.
  \item Make regularly scheduled pull requests to gradually introduce proposed
    changes in standalone components.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Importantly, Kubernetes is an active project, and it will
        be important to continuously merge our changes to decrease the cost on
        ourselves and on the project maintainers of combining two divergent
        branches.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Evaluate proposed changes to determine their validity and performance.
  \item Make necessary changes and extensions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}

Fairly defined methods and metrics exist for
measuring the efficiency of cluster managers. Particularly, we will define a
singular metric to measure the success of autoscaling, and then compare the
values of this metric when running both statistically simulated and historically
recorded data on Kubernetes with, and without, our modification.

Additionally, Kubernetes is a system used to run a variety of different types of
applications, in a variety of different environments. Equivalently, our
modifications to autoscaling will undoubtedly incorporate many tunable
parameters and application-definable variables. An additional goal is
determining the use cases in which our modifications are most effective, and
just as importantly, the use cases in which they are least effective. In
conjunction, after making our modifications we seek to determine a suitable,
default behavior for autoscaling.

Part of the appeal of this thesis is the ability to contribute to a
system running applications used by millions of people each day.
Thus, a final metric of success is the extent to which the method and
implementation we use to improve autoscaling conforms to
the architecture and standards of Kubernetes, and the extent to which our
modifications are accepted by the Kubernetes community.
